Then I added some extra features:
- Remember level and gamestate
- ALT + Arrow: keep walking
- CTRL + Arrow: walk 5 steps
- SHIFT + Arrow: walk to the end of the line
- Mouseclick: teleport, cheating is not possible, shortest route to destination is calculated, if possible, and steps are added.
- CTRL + Z: undo
